                <h1>Hi, I'm Tim Johnson. Here's a quick summary of myself:</h1>
                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    If I (Tim Johnson if you didn't catch that by now) were to choose three descriptions for myself,
                    I would pick software engineer/math guy, someone who watches anime and cartoons more often than 
                    live-action television, and well-adjusted adult. Some day, you might be able to find more out about
                    me at my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently my projects are few, but the gears are turning. You can find them on my 
                    <a href="/projects">projects</a> page. In my personal free time, I like to play D&D 
                    (if my friends could ever find the time), meditate, and maintain a blissful ignorance of pop
                    culture and most social media platforms. 
                </p>
                <h2>What do I want?</h2>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I want to gain a broad range of experience in many different areas of computer
                    science. As a student halfway through college, the exposure to different topics will hopefully give
                    me a stronger idea of what things I enjoy doing and what I do not. So far, I have discovered that
                    I want my future career to involve more math than my current internship using web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my personal goals, I'm currently in pursuit of self improvement. Among my goals are to
                    branch out socially, become the best physical version of myself, and explore creative activities.
