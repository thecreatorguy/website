        We were faced with a problem: in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars">Terraforming Mars</a>,
        you must shuffle several hundred cards together to form the deck, and more cards with each expansion. 
        It was getting ridiculous. I wanted to make a simple simulation that would handle all of the cards for us 
        while we played the game. This project did not go that route.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, I simplified it to allow us to play another home favorite, Hearts. I currently have a rudimentary
        frontend, but a fully robust backend that makes use of Websockets, goroutines and channels to have fully
        asynchronous gameplay that allows a player to reconnect when they lose connection, while still keeping track
        of the connections to close any threads that are no longer in use. It was quite the challenge!
    </p>
    <p>
        I suspect the next improvements to this will be a stab at React for a decent front facing experience, and to
        add more games to be able to play (maybe Terraforming Mars will make a return).

        I wanted to experiment with my newfound knowledge in AI from various sources like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q">CodeBullet on YouTube</a>
        and my Intro to Artificial Intelligence class at RIT, and I asked myself, "what's the simplest, yet still interesting
        project I can reasonably complete?" The result was an artificial intelligence that plays Flappy Bird- a game
        with one output, whether or not to jump.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to implement it with a neural network. After realizing that there is no "right answer" to the network,
        I knew that the network needed to be trained somehow, and decided on a genetic algorithm. How many layers are
        in the network, what inputs are used, learning rates, population size per generation, all of these attributes
        are able to be modified before starting to see what AI training method gets to 1,000,000 points the fastest!

    <h2>Slider Game</h2>

    <p>
        Slider is a game that I originally created for my senior project in high school. My only objective was to
        make a game, any game. And that's exactly what I did! After a short foray into C++, I decided that I should
        probably choose something more achievable for my skill level. I made a small game using a grid and a character
        that moves in straight lines, sliding until reaching a solid object, and passing between and over obstacles
        like lava, switches, and teleporters to make the puzzle game a little challenging. The original game was
        created in Python 2.12 and with a graphics library called PyGame. Unfortunately, this made the game difficult
        to show to my friends and family. For this reason I chose to port the game to the web using Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        During freshman year of college, I learned about graphs and breadth-first search in CS2. I thought that
        would be perfect to apply to my old project for finding the shortest solution to each of my hand-crafted
        levels. It actually found a shorter solution for my 11th level!

    <p>
        In my search for a career post graduation, I found a post on Reddit that asked for work on a project to see results.
        I thought, hey, I need experience doing web frontends and backends quickly, might as well just get this one going.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result is Shaksearch. It was requested to enhance a barebones Shakespeare search engine to what we thought
        a user would like, and I think I did a pretty good job. If you check out the Github repo for this project, you
        will see my thought process as I was doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
        NOTE: I am currently not hosting this because I am on AWS free tier, and it uses quite a bit of memory to hold
        the entire works of Shakespeare.

    <h2>Website</h2>
    <div class="links">
        <a href="#" class="button">Check It Out!</a>

        This website has gone through several iterations. First, it was simply a static webpage for hosting my projects
        like my very first project, the slider game. I learned these skills during my first semester at RIT in my web
        dev class, which taught me the basics like HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next iteration was after I started learning PHP. This was during my first internship/coop at
        <a href="https://www.morevang.com/">More Vang</a> where the backend was primarily written in PHP, and used the 
        Laravel framework. I decided to go a different route with my website and make it simple- I used
        <a href="https://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>, a very small framework. This was the iteration that created
        the visual design (CSS becomes much easier to handle with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>) and the
        blog that sits on a SQL database, which can be updated via API routes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current iteration rewrites the PHP framework into Go, making comparatively few frontend changes. Additionally,
        I migrated the website to Google Cloud services, which worked until it didn't and I switched to AWS. This allowed me a much
        greater flexibility in how I work with the backend, although it forces me to set everything up myself. To do this,
        I used Docker to containerize my Go website, and Docker Compose to instantiate it with a persistent store Postgres
        container as my database.
